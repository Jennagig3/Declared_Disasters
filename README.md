# Declared_Disasters

I wanted to create a project based on a weather dataset I obtained from Kaggle, which was previously obtained from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As we see on the news and often experience ourselves, natural disasters occur all over the U.S., with some areas being more affected than others. This dataset begins in 1953 and extends into 2023 for current data. In order to potentially predict where help is needed, it's imperative we reflect back on the data to see trends and possible places of extra attention, preparation and warnings. 

I used SQL functions such as COUNT to find the total number of declared disasters, and TOP 10 to find the highest and lowest states with disasters. Additionally, I used the WHERE function to query certain words, like Hurricane, and CASE WHEN to compare where areas were declared.
